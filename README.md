#### What is Matrix?

[Matrix](https://matrix.org) is an open network for secure and decentralized
communication. Users from every Matrix homeserver can chat with users from all
other Matrix servers. You can even use bridges (also called Matrix appservices)
to communicate with users outside of Matrix, like a community on Discord.

#### What is the goal?

An efficient Matrix homeserver that's easy to set up and just works. You can install
it on a mini-computer like the Raspberry Pi to host Matrix for your family,
friends or company.

#### Can I try it out?

Yes! You can test our Conduit instance by opening a client that supports registration tokens such as [Element web](https://app.element.io/), [Nheko](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/nheko/) or [SchildiChat web](https://app.schildi.chat/) and registering on the `conduit.rs` homeserver. The registration token is "for_testing_only". Don't share personal information. Once you have registered, you can use any other [Matrix client](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients) to login.

Server hosting for conduit.rs is donated by the Matrix.org Foundation.

#### What is the current status?

Conduit is Beta, meaning you can join and participate in most
Matrix rooms, but not all features are supported and you might run into bugs
from time to time.

There are still a few important features missing:

- E2EE emoji comparison over federation (E2EE chat works)
- Outgoing read receipts, typing, presence over federation (incoming works)

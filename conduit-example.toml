# =============================================================================
#  This is the official example config for Conduit.
#  If you use it for your server, you will need to adjust it to your own needs.
#  At the very least, change the server_name field!
# =============================================================================


[global]
# The server_name is the pretty name of this server. It is used as a suffix for user
# and room ids. Examples: matrix.org, conduit.rs

# The Conduit server needs all /_matrix/ requests to be reachable at
# https://your.server.name/ on port 443 (client-server) and 8448 (federation).

# If that's not possible for you, you can create /.well-known files to redirect
# requests. See
# https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#get-well-known-matrix-client
# and
# https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.4#get-well-known-matrix-server
# for more information, or continue below to see how conduit can do this for you.

database_path = "/var/lib/matrix-conduit/"
# The path to the unix socket for the admin cli
#unix_socket_path = "/var/lib/matrix-conduit/admin.sock"

# The port Conduit will be running on. You need to set up a reverse proxy in
# your web server (e.g. apache or nginx), so all requests to /_matrix on port
# 443 and 8448 will be forwarded to the Conduit instance running on this port
# Docker users: Don't change this, you'll need to map an external port to this.
port = 6167

[global.well_known]
# Conduit handles the /.well-known/matrix/* endpoints, making both clients and servers try to access conduit with the host
# server_name and port 443 by default.
# If you want to override these defaults, uncomment and edit the following lines accordingly:
#server = your.server.name:443
#client = https://your.server.name
